## How to Use
1. Click "Choose File" (or drag & drop) to load an image.
2. Adjust the crop and use the Zoom slider as needed.
3. (Optional) Click "Remove Background (AI)". First run downloads the model (~10â€“20s, cached by the browser where possible).
4. Click "Make it fit" to auto-center a square crop.
5. Click "Download 256Ã—256" to export a circular 256Ã—256 WebP. The app adapts quality to stay under 200KB and warns if it canâ€™t.
6. Use the sun/moon button (top-right) to toggle dark mode.

## Privacy & Performance
- All processing is in-browser. Images never leave your device.
- Background removal downloads a segmentation model from Hugging Face CDNs at runtime and executes locally (WebGPU preferred, falls back to WebGL/CPU when needed).
- Large images are resized to max 1024px on the longest side before segmentation for speed and memory efficiency.

## Accessibility
- Buttons and controls have accessible labels
- Keyboard- and screen reader-friendly components courtesy of Radix/shadcn

## Known Limits
- Extremely detailed or noisy images may exceed 200KB even after compression; the app will notify you.
